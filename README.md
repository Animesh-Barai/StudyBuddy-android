# StudyBuddy
Welcome to StudyBuddy! This project is currently a work in progress and is unfortunately delayed by other events.

## About
This app started when someone told me that since I was excellent in coding (example [MyFirstGame](https://github.com/Chan4077/MyFirstGamw)) and this app is meant for those who would like a study calendar.

## Current status
Currently, the project is in **BETA**.
There will be an APK download coming soon! Stay tuned! :tada:

## TODO
- Add calendar
- Add different views (Use `Fragment` etc.)
- Google Sign-in support (aka Firebase) for abilities to save to the cloud
- Gitignore `.idea` files
- Add screenshots
- Add this app to the play store

## Features
- Add a new task and can be undone via a snackbar
- Mark a todo as done (For some reason, it's a bit broken)
- Settings (Currently doesn't affect anything)
